# Python-Adventure-ascii-game
Final school project on Blekinge Tekniska Högskola for the course: "Programmering och Problemlösning med Python"

An simple adventure game made with ascii art, by using commands through the command line you should "puzzle" your way through the levels to try and play out the game. If you get stuck, press "h" or "help" once the game is running to see the options.

I personally have Cygwin set up for my python projects, so to start the project i use cygwin to go to the right folder and type: "Python3 adventure.py". 
To quit the game you just have to write "quit" in the command line.



---- What i learned -----

- Python argparse (argument parser)
- Read and write in files (text documents)
- Since this was my very first real project on python and programming as a whole, i learned a lot about the main programming logic and principles
